<h1>Skills...</h1><hr><hr>

<b>Teamwork:</b> From many of my past experiences and in college I worked and thrived as part of a team.<br>
<b>Agile:</b> Throughout my experiences my experiences I have been exposed to agile like environments. Especially in<br> 
college where we tried to mimic this as closely as possible through things such as code reviews and catch -ups.<br>
<b>Communication:</b> Especially from my time at SAP, I have developed strong communication skills from speaking <br>
with a wide range of people.
